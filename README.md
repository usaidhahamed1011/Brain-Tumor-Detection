# 🧠 Brain Tumor Detection System
📌 Overview
The Brain Tumor Detection System is a deep learning-based model designed to classify MRI images into two categories:
✔️ Tumor (Yes) – MRI scans showing a brain tumor.
✔️ No Tumor (No) – Normal MRI scans without a tumor.

This project utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to analyze MRI images and provide accurate predictions. It includes image preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and real-time predictions.

🔧 Technologies Used
Python – For implementing the deep learning pipeline.
TensorFlow/Keras – To build and train the CNN model.
OpenCV – For image processing (grayscale conversion, resizing, histogram equalization).
NumPy & Matplotlib – For data handling and visualization.
Scikit-learn – For train-test splitting and performance evaluation.

🚀 Features
✅ Image Preprocessing – Converts MRI images to grayscale, resizes them, and normalizes pixel values.
✅ Deep Learning Model – A CNN-based architecture with convolutional, pooling, dropout, and dense layers.
✅ Data Augmentation – Uses techniques like rotation, zooming, flipping, and shifting to improve model accuracy.
✅ Train & Test Split – Automatically divides the dataset (80% for training, 20% for testing).
✅ Performance Evaluation – Calculates model accuracy and visualizes predictions.
✅ Real-Time Prediction – Loads and classifies new MRI images with confidence scores.

🔜 Future Improvements
🔹 Web Application Deployment – Integrating the model with a Flask or FastAPI backend.
🔹 Database Support – Storing MRI images and prediction results in a MySQL or MongoDB database.
🔹 Advanced Architectures – Experimenting with ResNet, EfficientNet, or Transfer Learning for better accuracy.
🔹 Mobile Application – Developing an Android/iOS app for real-time MRI scanning and predictions.
